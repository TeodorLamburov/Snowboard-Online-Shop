                <h3>The Mountains<br>Snowboarding</h3>
                <p class="m_1">Snowboarding is a recreational activity and Winter Olympic and Paralympic sport that
                    involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet.

                    The development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was
                    developed in the United States in the 1960s, became a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and
                    eventually was featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014. Its popularity (as measured
                    by equipment sales) in the United States peaked in 2007 and has been in a decline since.</p>
                <p class="m_2">Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon, Michigan,
                    invented a toy for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so
                    he would have some control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. Dubbed the "snurfer"
                    (combining snow and surfer) by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters'
                    friends that.</p>
